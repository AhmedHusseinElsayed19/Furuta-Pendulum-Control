# Furuta-Pendulum-Control
Model and simulate the operation of a Furuta Pendulum in Matlab, Simulink and afterwards perform an interface control with a DS1104 board using dSpace.
 Apply the main concepts of “Control Systems Theory and Design” in order to design the most effective control gain, control poles, observer gain and observer poles of the system using powerful Matlab tools such as the LQR and pole placement commands.
